    "of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data\n",

    "We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.\n",

    "Specifically, in this project you should:\n",
    "- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could\n",
    "collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their\n",
    "relationships with each other.\n",
    "- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the\n",
    "data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",
