    "- A simple hypothesis prediction of the relationship between the variables; whether there is relationship between the age of the child, their sex, older siblings or not AND if they wrote a letter to Santa Claus. From the data siulation and analysis oerfomred above I amable to say with a certain degree of confidence that the closer the child gets to age 11 couple with spending above average (>5) hours per week on a mobile device, the less likely they are to write a letter to Santa Claus. There is small leaning in the data to suggest girls are more likley in general to write letters to Santa up to age 12 but not enough evidence to make a conclusive extrapolation. Similarily might expecation that children with older siblings were more likely to write a letter to Santa Claus remains unproven based on this synthesised data set.\n",
    "- The logical hypothesis prediction with a proposed explanation possessing limited evidence that girls between the age of 7 and 12 are more likely to write a letter to Santa Claus than boys is as mentioned largely unproven based on this dataset, perhaps a larger dataset than this might help in finding evidence for this logical hypothesis.\n",
